# Grassland-Change-Detection-Remote-Sensing Change Detection from Grasslands to Arable Lands with help of Sentinel 2 Satellite

These R scripts are part of continuous research, that is part of Ph.D. project in order to develop reliable method for mapping changes from grasslands to arable lands with help of Sentinel 2 satellite data. Demonstration data of vegetation index NDWI2 can be found here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zphhggj2ch/1
